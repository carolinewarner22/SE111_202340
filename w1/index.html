        <p class="paragraphstyle">Hi! My name is <u>Caroline</u> and I am in my second quarter at the New England Institute of Technology. I am studying <b>Software Engineering and Web Development</b>! Some of my hobbies include playing videogames, watching movies and shows, and playing music. I also like to spend time with my two cats, Sparky and Midnight. I have previous experience with HTML, but I've never worked with JavaScript so I'm <i>excited</i> to be in this class!</p>
