The movie centers on Doss, portrayed by Andrew Garfield, a conscientious objector and medic during World War II. Despite enlisting in the U.S. Army, Doss's personal beliefs prevent him from carrying a weapon, leading to challenges and discrimination from his peers.<br><br>&nbsp;Set during the Battle of Okinawa, the film unfolds as Doss faces the harrowing reality of war. Amidst heavy fire and danger, he displays exceptional courage by rescuing wounded soldiers on the front lines. Doss's unwavering commitment to his principles and his extraordinary acts of heroism ultimately earn him respect and recognition, making "Hacksaw Ridge" a poignant exploration of faith, conviction, sacrifice, and the enduring power of compassion in the midst of adversity.</td>
