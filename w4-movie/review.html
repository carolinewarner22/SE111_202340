                <p class="review">&nbsp;<em>Hacksaw Ridge</em> is an outstanding movie that really hits the spot on so many levels. Andrew Garfield totally killed it as Desmond Doss - his performance was just off the charts. You could really feel the guts and determination of Doss coming through, especially when he's facing the craziness of war as a pacifist. Props to Garfield for making it all feel so real and relatable.<br>&nbsp;The director of this gem, Mel Gibson, knows how to blend the harshness of war with those moments that hit you right in the feels. It's fantastic how they stuck to the true story of Desmond Doss - that's something you don't see every day in movies. I thought the pacing was perfect! Kept me glued to the screen the whole time, whether Doss was dealing with his own personal struggles or right in the thick of the battle on Hacksaw Ridge. <em>Hacksaw Ridge</em> is definitely one for the books, showing how killer performances and kick-butt direction can make history come alive on the big screen.</p>
